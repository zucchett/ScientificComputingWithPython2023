    "This exercise consists in analyzing a dataset containg timing information from a series of Time-to-Digital-Converters (TDC) implemented in a pair of FPGAs. Each measurement (i.e. each row of the input file) consists of a flag that specifies the type of message ('HEAD', which in this case is always 1), two addresses of the TDC providing the signal ('FPGA' and 'TDC_CHANNEL'), and the timing information ('ORBIT_CNT', 'BX_COUNTER', and 'TDC_MEAS'). Each TDC count corresponds to 25/30 ns, whereas a unit of BX_COUNTER corresponds to 25 ns, and the ORBIT_CNT is increased every `x` BX_COUNTER. This allows to store the time in a similar way to hours, minutes and seconds."
