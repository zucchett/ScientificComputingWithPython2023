    "Python is an **interpreted** high-level, general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of **significant indentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is **dynamically-typed** (the type of a variable is checked at runtime) and **garbage-collected** (to avoid manual memory management).\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",

    "Reference website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). Check it for documentation!\n",

    "Online documentation on [jupyter](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ipre/calico/raw/master/notebooks/Documentation/Reference%20Guide/Reference%20Guide.ipynb) is also available. Remember, Jupyter allows to edit and run Python code interactively, but Jupyter **is not** python!"
