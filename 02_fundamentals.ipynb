    "\n",
    "  * Packages:\n",
    "  A package is a collection of Python modules: while a module is a single Python file, a package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional `__init__.py` file, to distinguish a package from a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python scripts. Packages can be nested to any depth, provided that the corresponding directories contain their own `__init__.py` file.\n",

    "  A library is a collection of various packages. There is no difference between a package and Python library conceptually.\n",

    "Modules/packages/libraries can be easily \"imported\" and made functional in your python code. A set of basic libriaries comes with every Python installation. Others can be installed on the local machine and then imported. Your own code sitting somewhere else in your local computer can be imported too.\n",
