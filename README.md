# Final Projects for Scientific Computing With Python

In this branch of the repo, you will find the necessary information to complete your final project.

The project itself is presented and described in the `Project.ipynb` notebook, which also states the objectives and provides guidance to the development.
Other files, if needed, could be present.

Students are supposed to work together to produce a short report on the assigned task, including the code developed to achieve the results, which will have to be committed to the group repository. The contribution of each student should be made clear.

The code and the results should be included in a jupyter notebook, properly commented (just like a laboratory report) so it can be understood without a person explaining it, and including the results (plots, tables, etc.).

The notebook has to be committed with all the cells executed.
