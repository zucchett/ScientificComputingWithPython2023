    "\n",
    "The visualization of the results of an analysis represents one of the most delicate and important steps in data analysis, and typically tells a lot about the quality of the analysis itself. A good and bad examples are:\n",
    "   * the discovery of the [Higgs boson](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/Hig13002TWiki/HZZ4l_animated.gif)\n",
    "   * the claim of [superluminal neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4897v1.pdf)\n",

    "### Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are (1D) representations of the distribution of a certain feature $x$ of the data. Histograms can be thought as scalar functions, $f(x): {\\rm I\\!R}^n \\to {\\rm I\\!R}$. Histograms are often used to compare different distributions, for instance the data and its expectation (e.g. simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are **binned**, which means that the domain (\"range\") is divided in intervals (\"bins\", or \"buckets\"), and for the $i$-th bin $x_i<x\\le x_{i+1}$ and the content of the bin (say $n_i$) is  $n_i=\\frac{1}{x_{i+1}- x_{i}} \\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bins doesn't need to have the same size, i.e. it could well be that $(x_{i+1}- x_{i}) \\neq (x_{j+1}- x_{j})$ for $i\\neq j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the bin size is small, $\\lim_{(x_{i+1}- x_{i}) \\to 0} n_i \\simeq f \\left( \\frac{x_{i+1}+x_{i}}{2} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the number of bins and thus the bin size requires a special care. Typically, the content of each $i$-th bin, $n_i$, should be statistically significant, i.e. the corresponding Poisson uncertainty, $1/\\sqrt{n_i}$, should be small compared to $n_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the uncertainties affecting the data (or the expectation) should be reported as error bars, especially if the distribution is normalized or comes from a simulation (and thus needs to be weighted).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the Poisson uncertainty is valid only for random counts; in all other cases, the appropriate uncertainty should be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms could also be 2D, in that case the concept is the same but extended along a second dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shape and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The are essentially two main quantities that are conveyed by an histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The total amount of data, which is referred to as \"normalization\"\n",
    "   * The \"shape\" or differential distribution, which should follow the underlying probability distribution function (p.d.f.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "Both quantities can be expressed separately, by quoting $N=\\sum_i n_i$ the number of entries and displaying the original bins rescaled by $n_i / N$, such that $\\sum_i n_i = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the definition of normalization factor could be ambiguous; it could either be $N$ or $I=\\int f(x) dx$. The former is the most commonly used, but the latter is often the default of built-in methods in several visualization packages."
