    "# Simulation of a positron-induced Muon Source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of a high brillance muon beam is one of the most important challenge for the future of Particle Physics. A particularly interesting idea consists of directing a beam of high energy positrons to a target, aiming at the production of a pair of muons through the $e^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\mu^-$ process. To mimize the divergence of the resulting \"muon beam\", the positrons energy is chosen so that the reaction occurs close to the kinematical threshold (and assuming the electrons in the target to be at rest). The main goal of this project is to produce a realistic Monte Carlo simulation of such a process. \n",

    "## Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is split into two parts, which are both reported here for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: generate a simulated dataset of $e^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\mu^-$ events.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the process at leading-order cross section, $\\sigma(\\theta; \\sqrt{s})$, as a function of the scattering angle $\\theta$, and with the center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ as an input parameter. Start in the center of mass system. Pay attention that textbooks report such cross section in the relativistic limit, i.e. for $\\sqrt{s}\\gg m_\\mu$, which is not applicable in this case ($\\sqrt{s}\\sim 2m_\\mu$);\n",
    "2. compute and display the angle and momentum components distributions of the emerging muon pairs;\n",
    "3. boost muons four-momenta in the laboratory frame, i.e. in the frame where the electron is at rest and the positron has enough energy to initiate the process;\n",
    "4. write a Monte Carlo simulation that generates scattering events following the distributions found analytically; \n",
    "5. produce a synthetic dataset of about $N=10^5$ (or more) events. Events should be expressed as rows in a file with columns representing the muons coordinates;\n",
    "6. assume a $3$ cm thick Beryllium block is used as a target, and the rate of positrons on the target is $10^6$ Hz. Compute a rescaling factor (weight) you need to apply to each one of the $N$ simulated events such that they represent the statistics that would be gathered in a week of countinuous operations;\n",
    "7. repeat what has been done so far simulating the actual transverse shape and energy spread of the beam: for the former assume a flat distribution in a circle of radius $r=1$ cm and for the latter a gaussian distribution centered at the nominal beam energy and a width of $0.5$ GeV;\n",
    "8. given that the electrons traversing the target lose energy ($E(z)=E_0 \\exp{-z/X_0}$, with $z$ the longitudinal coordinate of the target, the one parallel to the beam direction and $X_0$ is the Beryllium radiation length), compute the nominal beam energy $E_0$ such that muon pairs can be generated along the whole length of the target.\n",
    "9. **Optional:** as in the previous point, take into account the loss of energy (and thus $\\sqrt{s}$) along the target when generating the events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: use the Monte Carlo dataset to design an experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume a $2$ meter long, $1.7$ Tesla dipole magnet is placed after the target. Assume a number of tracking detectors can be placed before the target, after the target before the magnet (in a single line) and after the magnet (two separate lines, one for positive the other for negative muons); those could be made of silicon pixels, with a single-hit resolution varying from 50 to 200 ${\\rm \\mu m}$.  \n",
    "Try to address the following items keeping in mind the cost of the constructionmof the experiment (i.e. you cannot buy an infinite number of detectors and the smaller the single-hit resolution the higher the cost) and that the layout of the experiment has to be as compact as possible (say whithin 20 m).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the sizes of the various detectors, such that all the particles pass through them (i.e. $100\\%$ detector acceptance); \n",
    "2. have each event of the Monte Carlo dataset \"interacting\" with the detectors, i.e. generate a dataset with the hits (properly smeared due to detector resolutions) left by particles crossing each detector. That should correspond to the actual measurements gathered by the experiment;\n",
    "3. add some random noise to the hit measurements (e.g. for each detector accordingly to poisson statistic of mean about 1);\n",
    "4. develop an algorithm to reconstruct the trajectories of the particles, both the incoming positrons and the outgoing muons.\n",
    "5. keep in mind the fact that the two muons emerge synchronously from the target: how small the pitch (the distance between individual pixels) has to be prior to the magnet? If that is too small, adjust the tracking algorithm accordingly (i.e. the reconstruct muon tracks could share hits in those detectors) \n",
    "6. compute the resolution of the muon momenta and of the reconstructed $\\sqrt(s)$.\n",
    "7. **Optional**: correct the muon trajectories for the transverse position of the hard scattering on the target volume. The incoming positrons are both dispersed in space (with flat distribution with $r=1$ cm).\n",
